      <h2>3 Foods to Look Out For in 2016</h2>
<p class="meta">04 Jan 2016</p>

<div class="post">
<p>There have been some pretty solid food additions to my diet in 2016, but there are 3 that stand out particularly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
<li>Butter</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
</ul>

<p>Heavy whipping cream took the place of half-and-half for morning  coffee, and it definitely kicks it up a notch.  I get all kinda work done.</p>

<p>Butter has been going in everything lately, from scrambled eggs to bread, even waffles.  I&#39;ve been putting the butter in the microwave for a few seconds, just to help it spread easier.  I really hate it when the butter is hard and unable to be spread, it just destroys the waffle, especially if it&#39;s a weak waffle to begin with.  Speaking of which, I&#39;ve been putting the waffles in the toaster oven lately, and the difference is remarkable.  I find that the toaster burns the outside too much, but fails to cook the inside sufficiently, no matter what I set the dial to.</p>

<p>Garlic is going to be making waves in 2016, and it&#39;s not just gonna be some fad ingredient.  I&#39;ve been rocking with the garlic for a minute now, but I tried putting some in the rice cooker with a bay leaf and some white rice, and it&#39;s sensational.  I plan to use the whole garlic cloves more in 2016, instead of that minced garlic in the jar.</p>
